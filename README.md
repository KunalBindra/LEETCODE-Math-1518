# LEETCODE-Math-1518
Sure, let's perform a dry run of the provided `numWaterBottles` method in the `Solution` class. We'll walk through the code step-by-step with a given example to see how the function works.

### Example:
Suppose we have `numBottles = 9` and `numExchange = 3`.

### Initial Setup:
- `numBottles = 9`
- `numExchange = 3`
- `ans = numBottles = 9`

### Dry Run:

1. **First iteration:**
   - `numBottles (9) >= numExchange (3)` is true, so we enter the loop.
   - Increment `ans` by 1: `ans = 10`.
   - Update `numBottles`: `numBottles = numBottles - (numExchange - 1) = 9 - (3 - 1) = 9 - 2 = 7`.

2. **Second iteration:**
   - `numBottles (7) >= numExchange (3)` is true, so we enter the loop.
   - Increment `ans` by 1: `ans = 11`.
   - Update `numBottles`: `numBottles = numBottles - (numExchange - 1) = 7 - (3 - 1) = 7 - 2 = 5`.

3. **Third iteration:**
   - `numBottles (5) >= numExchange (3)` is true, so we enter the loop.
   - Increment `ans` by 1: `ans = 12`.
   - Update `numBottles`: `numBottles = numBottles - (numExchange - 1) = 5 - (3 - 1) = 5 - 2 = 3`.

4. **Fourth iteration:**
   - `numBottles (3) >= numExchange (3)` is true, so we enter the loop.
   - Increment `ans` by 1: `ans = 13`.
   - Update `numBottles`: `numBottles = numBottles - (numExchange - 1) = 3 - (3 - 1) = 3 - 2 = 1`.

5. **Fifth iteration:**
   - `numBottles (1) >= numExchange (3)` is false, so we exit the loop.

### Result:
- The final value of `ans` is 13.
- Therefore, the method returns `13`.

### Conclusion:
The method correctly calculates the maximum number of water bottles that can be drunk given the initial number of bottles and the exchange rate. In this case, starting with 9 bottles and an exchange rate of 3, you can drink a total of 13 bottles.
